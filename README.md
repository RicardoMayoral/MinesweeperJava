# MinesweeperJava
MinesweeperJava is a fully working implementation of the popular logic puzzle computer game, Minesweeper, coded completely in Java.

This was originally a project that was created as part of ICOM4010 - Advanced Programming, which is one of the more important courses in Computer Engineering in the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez.

The course served as a strong reinforcement for multiple programming languages and utilized the Eclipse IDE on both Windows and Linux systems for its Java course projects, laboratories, and assignments.

Even though this course tackled both Java and Python as its main programming languages, this project began as part of the Java section of the course and was later on completed with full 
implementations for the mechanics of Minesweeper.

The part that required the most work and time in this project were the mouse control mechanics for selecting everything ranging from the actual grid selections, to the Flag sets for revealing the mines.

Overall, this project allowed me to pursue my existing curiosities with Java at the time and gave me some strong skills that I would utilize and develop even further when I tackled Advanced Python programming.
